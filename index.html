                        Happy new year 2025!
                        With this new year comes new possibilities.
                        The LiDiSoft (for <strong>Li</strong>bre and <strong>Di</strong>sruptive <strong>Soft</strong>wares) enters a new stage.
                        LiDiSoft originally emerged from the frustration of bugs and feature limitations of some softwares and services.
                        And thus, in addition of their opacity on how they work underneath and how they handle your data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2025 will likely bring more alternatives and solutions.
                        In this regard, LiDiSoft will work on providing softwares and services.
                        Now the time has come for LiDiSoft to evolve from thoughts, drawings and designs to actual softwares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <!-- target -->
                        Let's be honest: LiDiSoft will never be an AWS-killer.
                        Or any real competitor to any top-tier Cloud Service Provider.
                        Instead, LiDiSoft aims to provide stable and reliable open-source softwares that will finally make it tend to provide CSP-like services.
                        In this perspective, all future softwares will come with all features available for free, none being blocked behind a paywall.
                        The self-hosted option will also be free, with only SaaS options and advanced support requiring payment, while being totally optional.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Good year 2025!
                    </p>
